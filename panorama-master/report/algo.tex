\section{Blending}
The size of the final result is determined after having all the transformations.
And the pixel value in the result image is calculated
by an inverse transformation and bilinear interpolation with nearby pixels,
in order to reduce alias effect.

For overlapped regions, the distance from the
overlapped pixel to each image center is used to calculate
a weighted sum of the pixel value.
I only used the distance along the $x$ axis to calculate the weight,
to get better result in panoramic image.
The result is almost seamless. Compare \figref{unbend-persp} and \figref{general-straighten}
to see the effect of blending.

\section{Cropping}
When the option \verb|CROP = 1| is set,
the program simply manage to find a rectangular with largest area within the original result.

A $ O(n \times m)$ algorithm is used, where $ n, m$ is the height and width of the original result.
The algorithm works like this:

For each row $i$, the update
\begin{flalign*}
  h[j] &= \begin{cases}0,& if\ i = 0\ or\ A[i][j]\ is\ outside\ the\ area\\ h[j] + 1,& otherwise\end{cases}\\
  r[j] &= \max\{ k \in [0, m) \cap \mathbf{N}: h[t] \ge h[j], \forall j \le t \le k\} \\
  l[j]  &= \min\{ k \in [0, m) \cap \mathbf{N} : h[t] \ge h[j], \forall k \le t \le j\}\\
\end{flalign*} for every $ j \in [0, n) $ can be done in amortized $ O(1)$ time, and the corresponding area is $ (r[j] - l[j] + 1) \times h[j]$.
After the iteration, the rectangular $[i - h[j] + 1, i] \times [l[j], r[j]] $ with maximum area is our result.

The cropped final result is shown in \figref{cropped}
